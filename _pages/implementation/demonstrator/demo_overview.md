In order to facilitate development both consuming and providing systems a demonstrator platform will be provided. ultimately this will offer the following capabilities:

* <span style="color:red">example of a consuming system</span>
* <span style="color:green">an authorisation service for generating and authenticating JWT tokens</span>
* <span style="color:green">a provider service, loaded with synthetic data</span>
* <span style="color:green">a website to: </span>
    * <span style="color:green">trigger certain calls</span>
    * <span style="color:green">link to useful information</span>
    * <span style="color:green">link to reset synthetic data</span>
    * <span style="color:green">generate JWT tokens</span>
    * <span style="color:green">link to annotated sample requests</span>
    * <span style="color:green">build version information</span>

N.B. in the list above text in <span style="background-color: green;color:white">green</span> indicates capabilities that are available now and text in <span style="background-color: red;color:white">red</span> indicates capabilities that are not currently available.

This platform will allow experimentation by development teams as well as assisting with some testing for assurance.
