GP Connect appointment booking could be utilised for a number of different booking workflows where the end point is a GP IT System. The most frequently anticipated flow is when services are booking directly into a patients own registered GP Practice. An example might be from an urgent care service such as UTC or a 111/IUC service.

The "default" workflow pattern for booking into a GP Practice where the patient is registered to that practice is clearly defined by the GP Connect documentation here
