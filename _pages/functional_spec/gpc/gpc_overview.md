GP Connect is a program and associated interoperability standard being developed by NHS Digital. It is a partner to the Care Connect standard that is mainly presented here. The scope of GP Connect covers a number of different capabilities in addition to appointment booking such as acccess to records. 

This section of the UEC booking standard is concerned with guidance to Urgent and Emergency care services and systems that are looking to utilise GP Connect for booking into GP Practice systems. Please refer to the main GP Connect documentation for technical guidance and information on engagement and assurance for GP Connect.

Documentation for the GP Connect Standard can be found <a href="https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/" target="_blank">here</a>.
