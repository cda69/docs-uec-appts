Support for "booking only" type services
Some services that are profiled on the Urgent Care Directory of Services are comissioned as "booking only" services. That is to say that they only accept referrals with an appointment. If no appointment is available then a referral should not be made. Currently the DoS referral workflows do not support witholding refferal options if no booking is made.

This will be supported in an upcoming release of the DoS. A new "service attribute" will be configurable against services. This will allow the service to be flagged as "booking only". Therefore is this attribute is present on the service all consumer systems should withold referrals.
