Most booking solutions including standards booking do not require a transfer of care message to be transmitted using ITK.

If it is decided by a service that accepting ITK referrals is desirable and their system is capable of receiving them then they can. However, there is a clear responsibility that they will be receiving these referrals and they need to be managed appropriately.
Ultimately the DoS lead in an area is in control of profiling a service for ITK messaging. It is therefore part of their assurance responsibility for adding an endpoint to MAKE SURE that the receiving service is both configured technically and also prepared operationally to start receiving ITK referrals. If this assurance is not obtained. The DoS lead must not add the endpoint to enable ITK messaging. It is their responsibility to ensure this.
