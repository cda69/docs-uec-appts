Proprietary solutions currently provide the ability to Book an appointment with limited capability to Cancel or Reschedule that appointment from within the actual booking workflow. 

None of the existing proprietary solutions support cancellations / rescheduling after the call has ended. 

The intention is for a national solution to support the full range of workflow actions expected from an appointment booking system. This includes the ability to cancel and ammend and existing appointment.
