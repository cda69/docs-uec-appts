Proprietary solutions currently provide the ability to Book an appointment with limited capability to Cancel or Reschedule that appointment from within the actual booking workflow. 

None of the existing proprietary solutions support cancellations / rescheduling after the call has ended. 

The intention is for a national solution to support the full range of workflow actions expected from an appointment booking system. This includes the ability to cancel and ammend and existing appointment.

The key challenge to overcome is how to support appropriate cancelling and rebooking of appointments for patients regardless of which service they have contacted. In order to acheieve this, a single national registry of appointments is required. This will allow any service with the correct authority to potentially remove or rebook an appointment made for the patient.
